# SimpleTodo
Project developed to serve as a study for the concept of Effects. It is a very simplified Todo-list WebApp.

This project was generated by Angular CLI . It is in Angular version 12.1.

### How to run the project
With node 12+ installed, run the command npm installand after finishing the installation, run the command npm run start

## Concept summary

To understand this summary, you need to understand the basics of Redux. Warning given, let's get to the summary.

Basically the Effects is the way we have to guarantee the treatment of side effects when we trigger Actions. We cannot forget that in Redux, Reducers must be made with pure functions.

So when we create an Effect, we are guaranteeing that Actions that need external queries, for example, also have a handling of possible errors and can direct the firing of specific Actions to moments of error.

The example of this project is the Effect of loadTodos. See:

```typescript
  loadTodos$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(getTodos),
      switchMap(() => {
        return this.loadAllTodos();
      })
    )
  );

    private loadAllTodos() {
    return this.todoService.getTodos()
    .pipe(
      map((todos) => {
        return { type: TodoActionTypes.LoadTodos, todos };
      }),
      catchError((error) => of({ type: TodoActionTypes.Error, message: error }))
    );
  }

```

As you can see, we have an effect that monitors the action of GetTodos. In this effect, we have the error handling in the generic method of loading All, causing the specific Action of error to be called in case there is a problem with the HTTP call.
